            <!--Day 1 Diary-->
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <h3>My tought process on the first day:</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding this is my newest mission.
        <br> 
        so why do i even try to understand it?
        <br>
        <em><s>I dont know</s></em>
        <br>
        <b>I DO KNOW!</b>
        <br>
        Might be because i <b>thrive</b> when challenged?
        <br>
        Im quite certain in my journey ahead of me i will find different challenges.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I find it very amusing already to do this basic html, the thirst to learn is real.
        <br>
        Just setting up the Git was fun and made my brain already start to find its own ideas,
        <br>
        that is just me, i cant really be satisfied with what is infront of me.
        <br>
        I want to know more when it rises inside of me, i want to figure things out,
        <br>
        might be a challenge for me during this course that my mind wander into things i shouldnt do
        <br>right now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just the lack of automation during the Git process makes my brain go, how do i make this more automated?
        <br><small><b>Disclaimer</b>: I realized using Git through VScode is amazing and very direct with lesser windows open.
        although maybe learning how to use the git bash is needed so i wont slack just yet :)</small>
        <br>
        it also makes me realize how much i enjoy a organized folder structure for my different projects i use my computer for.
        <br>
        each new part i go into gives me many new areas that clicks, really intresting how the branches works and im hyped to learn more in the days coming. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cant wait for tomorow and the days following!
        <br>
        <br>
        <small><b>Disclaimer</b>: i really am ashamed of how my code look atm... Cant decide how to format it for the most satisfying feeling! I spend so much time with this small tasks :D</small>
        <br> <strong>GIT IS AMAZING!</strong>

    <!--Day 2 Diary!-->  
    <br>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <h3>Travel leads to understanding:</h3>
    <p>
        Yesterday i had a travel day, going to Gotland from Stockholm, big transition, hustle and bustle to calm and quiet.
        <br>
        Realizing how having a day off after having a day where i dedicated most of my day to coding and understanding Git.
        <br>
        Really help to let things land in you, meanwhile i took my time trying to explain Git to someone that is not into IT or tech at all.
        <br>
        That helped me grasp much of what i did the day before. Trying to figure out more of Git while updating and restructure my code layout.
        <br>
        Having a garden full of fruit to take care of is fun, but takes time, coding and gardening is a great combo, clear your mind and fill your mind.

    <br>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <h3>Finally at Peace!</h3>
    <p>
        Today started great, slow and steady, a constant thought of Git and Html, sat down and tried to structure my code and play around more with Git.
        <br>
        Feel like ive found a good code structure now, gives me an nice overview of what im doing and where things land. Will start to add images now to make
        <br>
        my project feel a bit more alive. Going deep down the HTML rabbithole, i want to learn CSS and style stuff up now, please set me free!

    <!--Day 4 Diary!-->
    <br>
    <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <h3>Rest and relax, or not!</h3>
    <p>
        Today i had an inital idea to relax from coding, although i couldnt let it go really just yet. I spend this day
        <br>
        mainly searching more information about Git and VSCode found a few good videos showing off the power of VSCode which
        <br>
        made me realize what a powerful tool it is during this process and the faster i learn to work with it, the smoother
        <br>
        my whole experince will be. Spent friday night setting up my music setup in the house to play with it today!

    <h2>Day 5</h2>
    <h3>I went on screenbreak!</h3>
    <p>
        Finally a day in the sun, no computer screen for the whole day! Trying to not think about HTML or Git...
        <br>
        IÂ´ll be honest, it was hard, my mind keep going there, its a challenge its something i want to learn!
        <br>
        But at the sametime i had so much else to do, the storm was coming, i had to get the apples!
