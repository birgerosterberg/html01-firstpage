    <!--Day 1 Diary-->
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <h3>My tought process on the first day:</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding this is my newest mission.
            <br> 
            so why do i even try to understand it?
            <br>
            <em><s>I dont know</s></em>
            <br>
            <b>I DO KNOW!</b>
            <br>
            Might be because i <b>thrive</b> when challenged?
            <br>
            Im quite certain in my journey ahead of me i will find different challenges.
            <br>
            <br>
            I find it very amusing already to do this basic html, the thirst to learn is real.
            <br>
            Just setting up the Git was fun and made my brain already start to find its own ideas,
            <br>
            that is just me, i cant really be satisfied with what is infront of me.
            <br>
            I want to know more when it rises inside of me, i want to figure things out,
            <br>
            might be a challenge for me during this course that my mind wander into things i shouldnt do
            <br>right now.
            <br>
            <br>
            Just the lack of automation during the Git process makes my brain go, how do i make this more automated?
                <br><small><b>Disclaimer</b>: I realized using Git through VScode is amazing and very direct with lesser windows open.
                although maybe learning how to use the git bash is needed so i wont slack just yet :)</small>
            <br>
            it also makes me realize how much i enjoy a organized folder structure for my different projects i use my computer for.
            <br>
            each new part i go into gives me many new areas that clicks, really intresting how the branches works and im hyped to learn more in the days coming. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I cant wait for tomorow and the days following!
            <br>
            <br>
            <small><b>Disclaimer</b>: i really am ashamed of how my code look atm... Cant decide how to format it for the most satisfying feeling! I spend so much time with this small tasks :D</small>
