            Understanding this is my newest mission.
            <br> 
            so why do i even try to understand it?
            <br>
            <em><s>I dont know</s></em>
            <br>
            <b>I DO KNOW!</b>
            <br>
            Might be because i <b>thrive</b> when challenged?
            <br>
            Im quite certain in my journey ahead of me i will find different challenges.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I find it very amusing already to do this basic html, the thirst to learn is real.
            <br>
            Just setting up the Git was fun and made my brain already start to find its own ideas,
            <br>
            that is just me, i cant really be satisfied with what is infront of me.
            <br>
            I want to know more when it rises inside of me, i want to figure things out,
            <br>
            might be a challenge for me during this course that my mind wander into things i shouldnt do
            <br>right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just the lack of automation during the Git process makes my brain go, how do i make this more automated?
            <br><small><b>Disclaimer</b>: I realized using Git through VScode is amazing and very direct with lesser windows open.
            although maybe learning how to use the git bash is needed so i wont slack just yet :)</small>
            <br>
            it also makes me realize how much i enjoy a organized folder structure for my different projects i use my computer for.
            <br>
            each new part i go into gives me many new areas that clicks, really intresting how the branches works and im hyped to learn more in the days coming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I cant wait for tomorow and the days following!
            <br>
            <small><b>Disclaimer</b>: i really am ashamed of how my code look atm... Cant decide how to format it for the most satisfying feeling! I spend so much time with this small tasks :D</small>
            <br> <strong>GIT IS AMAZING!</strong>

        <p>
            Yesterday i had a travel day, going to Gotland from Stockholm, big transition, hustle and bustle to calm and quiet.
            <br>
            Realizing how having a day off after having a day where i dedicated most of my day to coding and understanding Git.
            <br>
            Really help to let things land in you, meanwhile i took my time trying to explain Git to someone that is not into IT or tech at all.
            <br>
            That helped me grasp much of what i did the day before. Trying to figure out more of Git while updating and restructure my code layout.
            <br>
            Having a garden full of fruit to take care of is fun, but takes time, coding and gardening is a great combo, clear your mind and fill your mind.

            Today started great, slow and steady, a constant thought of Git and Html, sat down and tried to structure my code and play around more with Git.
            <br>
            Feel like ive found a good code structure now, gives me an nice overview of what im doing and where things land. Will start to add images now to make
            <br>
            my project feel a bit more alive. Going deep down the HTML rabbithole, i want to learn CSS and style stuff up now, please set me free!

            Today i had an inital idea to relax from coding, although i couldnt let it go really just yet. I spend this day
            <br>
            mainly searching more information about Git and VSCode found a few good videos showing off the power of VSCode which
            <br>
            made me realize what a powerful tool it is during this process and the faster i learn to work with it, the smoother
            <br>
            my whole experince will be. Spent friday night setting up my music setup in the house to play with it today!

            Finally a day in the sun, no computer screen for the whole day! Trying to not think about HTML or Git...
            <br>
            I´ll be honest, it was hard, my mind keep going there, its a challenge its something i want to learn!
            <br>
            But at the sametime i had so much else to do, the storm was coming, i had to get the apples!

            Its time, its CSS time! Im so happy, ive never used CSS before, looking forward for this chapter in my journey,
            <br>
            although i didnt do any of it today except watch the videos during the evening just to get it into my mind before bedtime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spent most of the day making Äppelmos and Salmbärssylt, while doing some more HTML structure with Links and navigation
            <br>
            spent even more time structuring my code yet again, feels like ive found the way to do it finally, trial and error ...
            <br>
            Had a chat with Gustav that inspired me to look into the Gitkraken tool for my Git duties, looked very nice, will try and
            <br>
            figure it out maybe during the upcoming weekend, depending on how much time understanding of CSS takes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me this studies is a big part of a more sustainable life, both health wise and mind wise, to be able to use this time for
            <br>
            bettering myself and my way of living, giving time away from commuting and doing unhealthy tasks, so while studying i also try and
            <br>
            keep up a daily Yoga and Running practise. I will give a link to my favorite online Yogis, Breathe and Flow, and their perfectly beginner and sustain program.

            Today i felt i had to share a song from my study and focus playlist, this keeps me calm and help me get all the noise away around me,
            <br>
            because today i need focus, its time to style my Diary with CSS! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I shall not go into the depth of something before i understand it! Today i spent many hours styling my diary, it was fun,
            <br>
            but it took many many hours playing around with it, even forgetting to commit before i was "done". You will see my pictures floating,
            <br>
            its not what i wish for them to float with their own decision, i wish to control it all :D
